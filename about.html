        <p>Full-stack Product Designer. Self-taught, multi-disciplinary, and obsessed with the why behind everything. I’ve coded, led teams, designed frameworks, streamlined design systems, and helped many companies launch successful products.</p>
        <p>Driven by a passion for understanding how things work, I’m obsessively curious. From the early days of table-based layouts, I’ve always been fascinated by how design and engineering interact. Empathy allows me to zoom in usage addressing pain points without losing focus of execution.</p>
        <p>I believe in using minimal design to enhance clarity and maximize results. I build, tinker, and continuously learn—whether in design, code, and more.</p>
        <p class="site--main--colophon">Find me on Figma, GitHub, or LinkedIn—or probably not find me because I might be busy squinting at code, trying to make some pixels behave, or reverse engineer some repository to see what the buzz is all about.</p>
